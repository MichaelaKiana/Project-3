# Project-3

### Summary

[brief summary of the project]


### Overview

##### Data Collection

[Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview) was used to collect data on books authored by Stephen King and his pen name, Richard Bachman. Restrictions on the API allow for up to 40 rows to be pulled at a time. Thus, compling the data required multiple requests. MongoDB was used to compile the data into one database.
