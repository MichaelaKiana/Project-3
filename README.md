# Project-3

### Summary

[brief summary of the project]

### Overview

##### Data Collection

[Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview) was used to collect data on books authored by Stephen King and his pen name, Richard Bachman. Restrictions on the API allow for up to 40 rows to be pulled at a time. Our goal is not to have all of the exact books published by the authors, but to have a sufficient amount of data for the development of a dashboard. Obtaining our data required multiple requests. See static/data/get-request.py. MongoDB was used to compile the data into one database, static/data/mongo-king-bachman.json.

##### Data Cleaning
